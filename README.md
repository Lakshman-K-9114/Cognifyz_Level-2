# 📊 Data Science Internship – Level 2

### Cognifyz Technologies

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Level 2 tasks** from my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**.

In this level, the focus shifted from basic exploratory analysis to:

* Business-driven insights
* Service-based comparison analysis
* Price segmentation analysis
* Feature engineering for machine learning readiness

Dataset used: **9,551 restaurants × 21 features**

---

# 🧠 Level 2 Objectives

## 🔹 Task 1: Table Booking & Online Delivery Analysis

### 🎯 Goals

* Determine the percentage of restaurants offering:

  * Table Booking
  * Online Delivery
* Compare average ratings for restaurants with and without table booking
* Analyze service availability across different price ranges

### 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Percentage distribution using normalized value counts
* Grouped rating comparison
* Cross-tabulation between price range and delivery availability

### 💡 Key Insights

* A minority of restaurants offer table booking compared to non-booking restaurants.
* Restaurants offering table booking generally show slightly higher average ratings.
* Online delivery is more common in lower and mid price ranges.

📌 Business Interpretation:
Service availability can influence customer perception and market positioning.

---

## 🔹 Task 2: Price Range Analysis

### 🎯 Goals

* Identify the most common price range
* Calculate average rating for each price segment
* Determine which rating color represents the highest-rated restaurants

### 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Price range frequency distribution
* Grouped average rating analysis
* Rating color performance comparison

### 💡 Key Insights

* Budget-friendly restaurants dominate the dataset.
* Higher price ranges tend to have slightly better average ratings.
* Dark green rating color corresponds to the highest-performing restaurants.

📌 Business Interpretation:
Premium pricing often correlates with higher customer satisfaction, but expectations also increase.

## 🔹 Task 3: Feature Engineering

### 🎯 Goals

Enhance dataset for predictive modeling by creating new meaningful features.

### 🛠 Features Created

| Feature Name             | Description                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `Table Booking Binary`   | Encoded Yes/No into 1/0    |
| `Online Delivery Binary` | Encoded Yes/No into 1/0    |
| `Cuisine Count`          | Number of cuisines offered |
| `Name Length`            | Length of restaurant name  |
| `Address Length`         | Length of address text     |

### 💡 Why This Matters

* Converts categorical variables into machine-learning-ready format
* Adds behavioral and structural features
* Improves model interpretability
